		<p>This mountain is the most remote in the country, the tallest in the Nephin Beg range, and offers fantastic views of the surrounding countryside. When you approach it you realise just how appropriate the Irish name Corrshliabh, meaning "conspicuous mountain," is as it dominates the skyline.</p>

 

		<p>The closest road access by car is a gate (shown in google maps below) where there is a small lay-by for one or two cars. From here continue down the road for under a km then go down the road with the forestry gate on the left. You can either walk or mountain bike on the forestry road to the Altnabrocky shelter, just over 5km away. The shelter, built by the volunteer group Mountain Meitheal, has along with the wooden hut, a bench, fire pit, compost toilet and a nearby stream. From the shelter its another 1.3km down the road to the point where you exit the forest. There was wooden steps up here in the past but not much remains of them today.</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>Leave the forest and head northwest up the hillock to the unnamed corrie lake where you can stop to take in the steep cliffs on the west side of the lake and the view to the east along with the serene waters.</p>	
			
			 
			
		<p>From there head northwest along a dry river gulley, this is the steepest uphill of the climb. After that it is an easier walk along the gentle slope to the summit. The summit is marked by a large cairn called Laghtdauhybaun. From the summit there are panoramic views of the other Nephin Beg Mountains to the south, Achill island, the Mullet Peninsula and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Erris bog and Altnabrocky forest to the East.</p> 
			
			 
			
		<p>Heading back from the summit you can travel back down the same path you took up, or you can choose to continue along the relatively flat plateau to the south, descending down the steep southern face of Sliabh Carr towards the Scardaun loughs.</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>Once you reach Lough Kilnabinnia you can head east back to the forest again.</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>Overall, this mountain is visually stunning, offers fantastic views, a decent challenge and is perfect for anyone looking to escape the rush of modern society and spend some time in the peacefulness of Ireland's most remote place. </p>
