		<p>Corranabinnia is the second highest peak in the Nephin Begs, and offers some of the most stunning views, but it is also arguably the most difficult, especially the narrow arête between Corranabinnia and it's South-West top. Parking is at a picnic area shown in google maps below.</p>

 

		<p>From the starting point head south-east down the road and over
			the Glendahurk Bridge before reaching a farmers gate on your left,
			leading into a field to the right of the Glendahurk River.
			Pass through this gate, making sure to leave it as you
			found it, and continue through the field in a north-easterly direction
			for 350 m, keeping the river to your left, before reaching a
			wired fence . Where safe to do so pass over the fence, but take
			care not to damage the fence when passing over it.
			Once over the fence, continue walking in a north-easterly direction
			through wet and boggy ground for approx. 1.6 km until you
			reach the beginning of the spur leading up to Bengorm's summit.
			Head north up a deceptively tough slog through boggy conditions
			for 2.2 km before reaching the Bengorm summit, marked by
			a large stone cairn.
			</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>Once you're ready to leave Bengorm's summit head north-west. At
			first there's a dirt sheep track that is easy to follow, but the terrain
			quickly gets steeper as you progress, and the track becomes
			intermittent at best. In poor conditions a grid bearing of 320° from
			Bengorm's summit cairn will get you to Bengorm's North-West Top
			(NW-Top), though care should be taken when walking as sudden
			drops in elevation are prevalent and may be masked if visibility is
			hindered. After 900m of descending north-west you'll reach
			the saddle between Bengorm and Bengorm's NW-Top. Continuing
			along the horseshoe, after approx. 650 m you'll reach
			Bengorm's NW-Top. This peak, also known locally as Maumahieran, is not marked by any object, so locating the exact highest point is difficult. From here to the summit
			of Corranabinnia you'll get the best views of the Glendahurk Valley,
			a great vantage point for observing the rest of the horseshoe and
			looking down into the Glendahurk Valley to the left below.
			</p>	
			
			 
			
		<p>From the NW-Top continue west down a brief descent befo
			coming to the saddle between the NW-Top and the beginning of the
			spur leading to the Corranabinnia's summt.
			As approaching the start of the ridge straight on will lead to
			difficult climb through a steep and jagged rock face, head to the left
			(south-west) for 250 m before cutting north up moderate
			steep ground through heather and bog grass before reaching
			plateau, known locally as Cruachscaillabar.
			From here head west as the ground turns gradualy steeper as
			you make your final ascent to Corranabinnia. After heading west
			from Cruachscaillabar for approx. 800 m you'll arrive at
			Corranabinnia's summit, marked by a trig pillar.
			From Corranabinnia's summit on a clear day to the north you
			be able to see the ridge which runs all the way to Glennamong
			Mountain. To the north-west of the summit
			Corranabinnia Lough, while to the west you can see as far as the Corraun Peninsula and Acaill lsland. To the south, the trig
			pillar overlooks the Glendahurk
			Valley directly below, while to
			the south-west you'll be able to
			view the spectacularly rugged
			arête which you'll pass through
			shortly.
			
			</p> 
			
			 
			
		<p>Once ready to leave the summit,
			head south-west towards
			the arête. The journey from
			Corranabinnia's summit to its
			South-West Top (SW-Top) is
			approx. 650 m though
			crossing the arệte makes it feel
			much longer. After approx. 150m of descending the
			terrain will change from grass
			and heather to jagged rock as
			you arrive at the beginning of
			the arête. This section can
			be very dangerous, especially in poor weather conditions, so take care when walking. Keeping slightly to the left of the ridgeline, continue south-west as you scramble over
			craggy rock. In parts a dirt trail can assist in the climb, but these
			again are sporadic at best. When the terrain turns back from rock to
			mostly grass head for higher elevation but continue south-west until
			you reach Corranabinnia's SW-Top, known locally
			as Maol Rua. The
			summit has no marker to indicate the spot height.
			
			</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>From Corranabinnia's SW-Top continue south along the final part
			of the horseshoe. On a clear day you'l be able to follow the natural
			curve of the ridge as it gradually turns south-southeast, and as
			you descend a worn trail can guide you for much of the way. After
			approx. 3 km of descending you'l pass down the final part
			of the spur and onto much wetter ground. Continue south for a
			further 1.2 km before reaching a bog road heading south-
			east and down the hill. From here walk for
			approx. 1.1 km down the road, before arriving back at the
			roadside parking area where you began your hike earlier on to the
			right, completing your trek.
			</p>
