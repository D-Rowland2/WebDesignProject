		<p>Birreencorragh is situated near Newport in the South East Nephin Begs in an area of steep-sided valleys. It sits at the apex of the Glendorragha Valley and has a remote feel. It's a spectacular mountain when seen from the South and North West, while it slopes gently enough along a narrow ridge directly North and curls northeastwards towards Knockaffertagh to encircle the valley. There are extensive views over the rest of the nearby Nephins, Achill, Clew Bay and further afield to the Sligo hills and the Bluestacks.</p>

 

		<p>Parking for the climb is available at the Keenagh Loop trailhead beside Bellanderg Bridge (shown in google maps below). There is space for more than 6 cars available.</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>From the trailhead, head south over the bridge and and turn right, following the Keenagh loop in reverse for approx. 2.3km before reaching a patch of stone on the hillside to your right. This is where you leave the trail and head up the mountain. From here head West-Northwest up the mountain until you reach Knockaffertagh's summit cairn. From here you should be able to see Bireencorragh's summit and the ridge leading up to it.</p>	
			
			 
			
		<p>From here, follow the natural form of the ridge Northwest before it turns to the Southwest as you head up the spur leading to the summit. The summit is marked by a large cairn built around a destroyed trig pillar. From the summit there are amazing views in all directions. To the south you'll be able to look down into the dramatic Glendorragha valley, to the south-west the multitude of islands in Clew Bay can be seen, altough partially blocked by Buckoogh, and further West the other peaks of the Nephin Beg range can be seen.</p> 
			
			 
			
		<p>For the descent, you can either head back the way you come or continue on and complete a "horseshoe" circuit of the valley. If opting for the latter, head south-west following the natural curve of the ridge as it turns south. Continue on to Birrencorragh's South Top, marked by a small cairn. From here there are better views of Clew Bay and Croagh Patrick. Head downhill East-Southeast towards a forest. When you reach the forest, continue parallel to the treeline until you reach a river.</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>Once you cross the river, you will be back on the Keenagh loop, which you can follow back to the trailhead.</p>
