		<p>This is the mountain that the range is named after, with the name meaning "little Nephin" possibly coming from it's resemblance to the larger and more well known Nephin to the East of the range.</p>

 

		<p>For this route, park at the Letterkeen trailhead (shown below in google maps). For the first part of the route, you will take the Bangor Trail northwest along a river from the carpark until you reach the Lough Aroher Shelter, there are plenty of signposts to guide the way.</p>
			
			 
			
		<p>Sitting in the Lough Aroher Hut facing outwards, head north up the hill to your left covered in grass, heather and stone. The first part of the walk is usually quite wet in places so take care when walking. After ascending north for 700 m up the wide spur the terrain will level-off somewhat and you'll come to what feels like the start of the main ridge heading north west towards Nephin Beg. Head in a north-westerly direction for 350 m before reaching Nephin Beg's South Top marked by a small pile of stones. From here on a clear day to the north you should be able to see the route to Nephin Beg's summit generally bending to the right.</p>	
			
			 
			
		<p>From Nephin Beg's South Top descend north for 500m until you reach a saddle, where there'll be a stone wall running up the hill in front to the north. This part of the walk is usually very wet, so take care when walking. Follow the stone wall up the hill for 300m and continue past the wall northwest for a further 150m before reaching a plateau with an unmarked spot height and the start of final spur leading you towards the main summit. Follow the natural curve of the ridge north west for 400 m and then north for 800m before arriving at the Nephin Beg summit cairn.</p> 
			
			 
			
		<p>From the summit there are spectacular views in all directions. To the east you can see Bireencorragh, Nephin More and beyond out to the Ox Mountains. To the south Glenamong is the most visible peak, with the taller Corranbinnia behing. To the west lies the vast expanse of the Owendubh bog out to the Atlantic Ocean. </p>
			
			 
			
		<p>To return to the carpark, follow the same route back again.</p>
